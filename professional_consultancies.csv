Once the need is located, we proceed to formulate and propose the change initiative we believe suits our customers’ profile. Every project we undertake is therefore unique. We work with our customers; we collaborate to extract the maximum value for both parties. Funded programs demand thorough understanding of the notion of project management and that is what we do; we comprehend and deliver. The next step is materialization.

The bottom line and reputation of a business depends on its ability to operate within a positive public policy environment that establishes the framework of the marketplace of goods, services, ideas and issues. Public Affairs can create decisive competitive advantage and open market opportunities.

Beyond its own staff members, Context has grown to include a network of social entrepreneurs, local businesses, development organisations, policy makers and academics in Asia (mainly South Asia and Indo-China), Africa (mainly East and South Africa) and Europe (mainly the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and the UK).  
 
Organisations that are inspired and passionate about creating a positive change in society and those that aim for competitiveness and financial sustainability can count on the support of Context. We provide support to organisations to (re)position themselves; to understand, grow and scale their business models; and to better understand how to increase social impact. Professional research expertise and tailor-made support are core to our work, as we believe that every case is unique, faces unique challenges and is embedded in a unique environmental context.

Established in 1987, EPPA is a respected multi-disciplinary and multi-cultural consultancy with a pan-European reach. Our impressive track record in resolving major challenges related to public policy, regulatory affairs and societal issues is founded upon our in-depth knowledge, understanding and appreciation of European policy drivers and their interface with national political systems.  
 
Our unique approach, which respects European political tradition rather than try to impose an imported lobbying model, is so successful because we focus on creating a constructive dialogue with policy-makers; a dialogue that is cognisant of Europe’s rich cultural diversity.     
 
Be it for public policy, regulatory affairs or compliance we are specialists in institutional processes at both European and national levels. Compromise building is at the heart of what we do and we have built a reputation of working out sustainable solutions that are widely accepted and which build value over the long-term.   
 
Our expertise is in government and we work with all industry sectors although we are particularly recognised for our work in the fields of agriculture, chemicals, competition policy, energy, food, financial services, ICT and transport. Our clients are mostly multi-national companies but we also serve European or national industry federations and assist public authorities from outside the EU.  
 
Discretion and confidentiality are key to our work. We attach great importance to respect for ethical values and sustainable business excellence. As such EPPA offers an unparalleled depth of experience and record of success to its clients, many of whom have remained with us for years.

Seabury was founded in the United States in 1994 by airline industry insiders who recognised that trying to make sense of multiple different viewpoints from different advisors at once made business improvement far more complicated that it need be. Since then, Seabury’s management, led by John Luth, have worked to bring together the best specialist industry advisors under one roof, with one mission: we want to help our clients be successful. 
 
By 2003, we had grown from a primarily US based and US focused business into the world’s largest specialist airline advisory business that now employs over 150 professionals. As the airline industry developed into an ever more global business, in order to serve the needs of our clients better, we have built a global footprint. Seabury’s main offices are in London, New York and Hong Kong. We also have significant regional offices in Houston, Minneapolis, Washington DC, Toulouse and Amsterdam as well as individuals located in other areas. Since our international expansion in 2003, we have worked with the biggest names in aviation to help them overcome their unique business challenges, including all of the major airlines in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and English speaking Asia Pacific. 
 
Because we know there is nothing more frustrating for a client than to have to “teach the airline business” to an external consultant, we have built a number of highly specialised practices in the following areas: fleet strategy, network planning, revenue management, cargo, maintenance, flight operations, human capital/organisational development, information technology, and airline financial modelling. More importantly, each of these specialist practices is headed by and primarily staffed with former senior airline executives. 
 
We recognise that helping a business to overcome its challenges requires far more that repeating canned solutions and ""success stories"" from past projects. Each client’s situation is uniquely different and we have found that year-after-year the industry continues to become more competitive, making each strategic planning process more challenging. That is why our team of consultants works hand in hand with the clients and the specialists to ensure that the larger strategic questions are answered, that projects run smoothly, and that materials and deliverables are created based on the highest of professional standards. 
 
Airline strategic and operational business improvement activities require significant and specialised analysis of the data at hand. Recognising that Excel is not the best tool for much of this analysis, each of our specialist practices has built proprietary software tools and databases to assist our clients’ management teams understand their strategic situations, tactical contexts and to aid in the decision making processes. We are skilled at working with our clients to blend their confidential data with our external data to create a consensus for business improvement activities. 
 
We work every day to try to fulfil our singular mission: helping our clients be successful. We truly believe that this integrated approach to business improvement advice is unique and our clients tell us it provides the best solution for their business challenges.

Its founder, Joseph Huggard, based on more than 30 years of working with some of the most contentious public health and environmental issues, understands that maintaining a licence to operate is a major challenge for innovation-driven companies. From metals and chemicals to food and pharmaceuticals, industry competes with the agendas of other stakeholders, adept at creating a narrative for industry which sets it at a disadvantage when it comes to policy making and regulation. 
 
Dealing with this complex challenge demands a strategy of high quality health and environmental science, insightful communications and effective advocacy. Only through implementing this approach can industry insure that society benefits from its products. 
 
In The Huggard Consulting Group, we have put together a unique cross disciplinary team, which has unparalleled experience and expertise to help when your product, services or activities are being challenged. This team excels where science, regulation, politics and business meet.","European, global, national, regional/local","Endocrine Disruptors

Our clients needed the confidence that they were being served by Western-oriented and credible public affairs professionals. 
 
As we have grown, we have relied on seeking out the best in local consultants, management and staff. Our offices now employ over 40 people across the region and we continue to grow into new markets through using tested and professional consultants and partner agencies. We combine senior management that has years of experience in the region between them, with young, dynamic, and multilingual staff to service your needs professionally and effectively. 
 
Central European countries now play a crucial role in shaping the Brussels agenda, both through their national government representatives, and through their MEPs. Under the Lisbon Treaty, the European Parliament has an even greater role in shaping the long-term legislative environment of Central Europe. CEC helps you understand the new Central European players in the EU, and to access them effectively by leveraging our own two-decades long presence in the region. 
 
We have remained fiercely independent over the years, but we have also invested time in developing a network of relationships with partner public affairs and public relations companies in Europe, the UK and the United States.

Taraban in Croatian language refers to traditional Slavonian dance, it stands for people who are connected, and it also represents joy. Simply ‘’Taraban’’ is Slavonia and that is why company is named Taraban Lobi. 
 
Our first project was Bal Slavonaca (Sheraton Zagreb Hotel, 8th of February, 2013), a gala diner where all important people from Slavonia have gathered for the first time. Around 300 Slavonian people from different fields including: business, medicine, government, sports, law, politics, show business etc. Some of the our distinguished guests were President of Croatia, Croatian Parliament Speaker, also Minister of Economy and Minister of Agriculture (as agriculture is very important for Slavonia region). Through this event we wanted to show working and successful Slavonia and also to express our strenght through presence of our most distinguished and respectable individuals.  
 
Our second project was The Art of Lobbying. It is a specialised magazine which was created as a voluntary project of Croatian Society of Lobbyists in cooperation with the students of the Faculty of Economics, Faculty of Political Science and the Faculty of Law of the University of Zagreb, with professional support of the executive operating company Taraban Lobi. Taraban Lobi is publisher of specialised magazine The Art of Lobbying by publishing approval of Croatian Society of Lobbyists. 
 The necessity for creating this type of magazine was invoked by the need to enlighten the public on the inevitability of lobbying in the decision - making process in democratic systems. We believe that it is the right time for abolishing stereotypes associated with lobbying and for demystifying this profession. Due to Croatia’s accession to the European Union our first edition of The Art of Lobbying is published in June 2013. Also the main topics, in this first edition, is regulation of lobbying.

As the European Union continues to grow and become more influential, the need for organisations to have access to up to date information on the EU’s policy making process becomes more important. In excess of 80% of legislation, which has an impact on businesses within the Member States of the Union, is now initiated and approved at EU level. 
 
For many organisations the diverse and complex institutions of the EU are a mystery which absorbs precious time and resources. Organisations do recognise, however, the need to interact with the Council, the Commission and the Parliament. They must be able to participate in debates before policy decisions or legislation impacting on them, are made. 
 
Our experienced GHB team offers a range of services. We pride ourselves on the ‘personal touch’ as we steer our clients through the intricacies of the EU, and achieve for each of them an optimum solution. We provide support through: 
 
•    Providing information and advice on EU policies and directives likely to impact on the client's activities.

With more than 160 consultants and offices in Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Berlin and Brussels, HERING SCHUPPENER has specialized in strategic communications solutions for companies in mission-critical situations such as M&A transactions, IPOs, restructuring and change processes as well as crises. We advise our clients on a continuous basis in reinforcing their reputation and managing their brand, in management and controlling of international communications activities, in issues related to corporate campaigning and corporate affairs as well as in long-term press and investor relations activities. 
In April 2016, HERING SCHUPPENER formed a strategic partnership with Finsbury, bringing together their expertise as established leaders in the key financial and business centres of New York, Frankfurt, London, Hong Kong, Berlin and Brussels, and building a global platform across 14 offices with more than 350 professionals and four global practice groups covering Capital Markets, Crisis, Corporate Reputation and Corporate & Public Affairs. 
The Hering Schuppener Brussels office is focused on Corporate & Public Affairs, a specialized unit established in 2009. The team of 30+ consultants in Berlin, Brussels and Frankfurt advises clients on regulatory affairs, EU competition and all aspects of stakeholder interaction.  
We advise companies on how political, social and economic developments can impact their business model and how to strategically position in this context. This includes support in promoting legitimate interests and recommendations for optimal organisational structures in the areas Governmental Relations and Corporate Affairs. Our consulting approach is based on following principles: 
• Societal trends not only require companies to permanently reassess their market position and, where necessary, adjust their business model, they also offer new business and growth opportunities. 
• Positioning companies strategically requires pro-active commitment to good corporate citizenship. 
• Only an integrated stakeholder approach that consistently targets all parties critical to corporate success creates a solid foundation for sustainable corporate success. 
• On-going monitoring of the political and regulatory environment and the credible promotion of legitimate interests secure the ""licence to operate"" and create new business and growth opportunities. 
 
We are active in following segments: 
• Corporate Strategy: We analyse the impact of a company's political, societal and corporate environment on its business model and develop possible approaches that reduce potential risks while creating new opportunities. 
• Strategic positioning: We advise companies regarding the strategic positioning in the political and societal landscape. 
• Public Affairs M&A: Social and political goodwill have become a critical success factor for M&A transactions. Of particular importance is the political dimension of merger control procedures in major cross-border transactions. 
Competition and trade cases: Cartels and market abuses, state aid and trade disputes – the result of competition procedures by the EU Commission are of enormous importance to the affected companies and industry sectors. In order to be successful, a sensible political and communication approach alongside the formal legal procedure is key.  
• Advocacy: We support companies in credibly promoting legitimate interests by engaging with policy makers, regulators and the public. 
• CEO positioning / CEO Start: We advise clients in developing suitable strategies for the positioning of CEO’s and their companies.  
• Structural Review:We help companies to optimally align their organisation and processes with the needs of external and internal stakeholders. 
• Corporate social responsibility: We advise companies in developing and implementing tailore","European, national","Digital Single Market; Capital Markets Union; Financial Markets Regulation, Shadow Banking, Royalties; Energy Union; Circular Economy; Consumer Policy; Transport",,,,,,,12,5.75,9,"BINDER Björn, BURY Hans Martin, DE ANGELIS Biancastella, Dr. Tacke Nikolaus Gerd, HAUS Katrin, JACOBITZ Julian, PEUCKER Henriette, RADINGER Philippe, SCHRÖTER Benjamin","General and Institutional Affairs, Economic and Financial Affairs, Trade, Competition, Consumer Affairs, Culture, Energy, Enterprise, Environment, Taxation, Justice and Fundamental Rights, Internal Market, Research and Technology, External Relations, Trans-European Networks, Public Health, Food Safety, Information Society, Transport, Climate Action, Communication, Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union",Strategic partnership with Finsbury www.finsbury.com,,01/01/2015,01/12/2015,,800000-899999,,>1000000,"Honeywell, Thyssen Krupp, Der grüne Punkt - Duales System Deutschland GmbH (DSD - Duales System), Fontem Ventures, Commission for Art Recovery, Deutsche Bank AG, Stagecoach Group, Scandlines Danmark ApS, Ista International GmbH, European Bedding Industries' Association (EBIA)",,,,

COMPETITIVE & PROFITABLE MOBILE INTERNET ACCESS 
Founded in 2009, Rewheel is a Helsinki based boutique management consultancy specialising into strategies to meet Europe’s open mobile internet connectivity needs.  
 
Our clients are progressive mobile operators (network operators and MVNOs), sector regulators, as well as various companies and investors of Europe’s emerging digital economy. 
 
Our expertise covers competition, technology, spectrum, economic, financial modelling and regulatory aspects of the 'digital fuel' - ubiquitous open mobile internet connectivity. 
COMPETITIVENESS & PROFITABILITY FROM THE FINNISH PERSPECTIVE 
Among Rewheel's clients are the Finnish telecom and media regulatory authority as well as leading Finnish mobile operators. 
 
Finland has among the lowest mobile internet usage prices, the highest mobile data consumption per capita (over ten times higher than Germany's), the highest mobile broadband population penetration, as well as among the fastest mobile broadband networks and best 4G/LTE coverage. All mobile operators in Finland abide by strict net neutrality principles: operators do not apply vertical price-discriminations. Despite the mass-affordable open mobile internet offers and very heavy mobile data traffic the Finnish telecom sector generates healthy returns for its investors (16% ROCE for the market leader operator). 
INDEPENDENCE AND INTEGRITY 
Rewheel is fully independent from dominant telecom companies, equipment vendors and their industry lobby organisations such as GSMA, ETNO or ECTA.  
 
Our independence and integrity is demonstrated by the strong and straightforward, pro-competition public positions taken in top business media such as the Financial Times, Reuters, Bloomberg, European Voice or the Wall Street Journal. We are often quoted on the hottest industry topics - in 2014 it is whether telecom and competition regulators should allow in-market consolidations leading to higher operator profits or the opposite: promote stronger infrastructure and spectrum based competition, leading to faster networks and more affordable mobile connectivity prices for consumers and higher utilisation of scarce spectrum resources.  
 
Our consulting firm's small size and financial independence allows us to be selective on our engagements. If a client's objectives are in conflict with our general pro-competitive stand point, we do not undertake the project.

By working with corporations, philanthropists, charities and government entities who wish to maximize their social impact, our final goal is to eradicate poverty and tackle society’s most urgent issues, focusing on helping disadvantaged women and children without discrimination of race, background, creed or political views. 
 
A social business is a cause-driven business where the investors can gradually recoup the capital invested without taking any dividend beyond that point. Our mission is to create financially sustainable social businesses where all profits are reinvested into the company to solve the most urgent social and environmental issues. SBE operates as a social business itself and follows the principles defined by Nobel Peace Laureate Muhammad Yunus, Chairman of our Advisory Board.

Notre chiffre d’affaires a ainsi été multiplié par 13 depuis 2003 pour atteindre 879 M€ en 2013. Cette progression a été réalisée en combinant croissance organique et acquisitions majeures, notamment, Coframi en 2007, Aeroconseil en 2011 et la filiale de Daimler, MBtech, en Allemagne en 2012.

In un contesto competitivo rapido e globale in cui le relazioni hanno un peso ed un’importanza crescente, le imprese necessitano sempre più spesso di momenti di aggregazione che offrano opportunità di incontri ad alto livello con altre aziende, opinion leader e istituzioni. 
In questo scenario di riferimento, corrette attività di networking consentono alle società di pianificare e gestire le relazioni di alto profilo non solo nei confronti degli stakeholders istituzionali, ma anche dei propri partners strategici, prospect e clienti. 
Questi eventi nascono come risposta alle esigenze delle aziende, offrendo l’opportunità di entrare a far parte di un ristretto e selezionato gruppo di lavoro che raccoglie, in eventi di altissimo livello, la propria rete di relazioni.  
Alla luce dei successi delle edizioni passate svoltesi in Italia, si è deciso di rafforzare il ruolo e la portata della community con un nuovo progetto pensato per le grandi aziende che necessitano di instaurare rapporti stabili e duraturi con le Istituzioni comunitarie.  
 
Il ciclo di eventi pianificato quindi porrà al centro della discussione i problemi e le sfide più attuali della politica, dell'economia, della cultura e della società, con un'attenzione particolare alla business community italiana e internazionale nello scenario europeo.  
Il tutto in un contesto che, come sempre, ha lo scopo di consentire un effettivo aggiornamento dei temi trattati. 
I contenuti e le attività prevedono, oltre agli eventi, un percorso di accompagnamento e approfondimento costante nel corso dell’anno: 
•    Appuntamenti di alto profilo relazionale accompagnati da momenti conviviali con ospiti d’eccellenza dello scenario istituzionale sui temi dall’attualità politica ed economica;

Cualquier política que afecte a la I+D+i europea es del interés de ZABALA, desde los sectores más tradicionales e industriales, hasta aquellos más ligados al cambio de modelo productivo: biotecnología, nanotecnología, TICs, energía y medio ambiente, salud, etc.

L’intento è ampliare il proprio ambito territoriale di azione, sviluppando impresa in modo innovativo in tutta Europa e focalizzando le diverse attività sul concetto di “rete”, al fine di sviluppare e condividere progettualità di alto livello congiuntamente a partners internazionali referenziati. Infatti, solo attraverso un continuo lavoro di costruzione di reti e pubbliche relazioni di alto livello possono nascere sinergie efficaci, capaci di produrre valore per ogni progetto ideato e presentato sui bandi UE. 
In una Europa in cui l’obiettivo prioritario è unire e non disgregare, Extramoenia d.o.o. pone al centro della propria azione la creazione di un sistema innovativo, finalizzato alla costruzione e al mantenimento di partenariati qualificati e di solide reti, referenziate e costanti nel tempo, non frutto di connessioni casuali e improvvisate, in grado di portare valore aggiunto e benefici economici e progettuali al “Committente” già nel breve e medio periodo. 
La “mission” di Extramoenia d.o.o. è finalizzata a: 
•accrescere la visibilità del “Committente” a livello internazionale, attraverso percorsi mirati, atti a creare eccellenze nei settori di riferimento e tramite il confronto diretto con partenariati qualificati di Paesi esteri; 
•ideare e realizzare progetti con un elevato grado di innovazione, sostenibilità e continuità (follow up), per creaare modelli virtuosi e replicabili in altri ambiti territoriali; 
•creare, a livello internazionale, legami sempre più stretti di cooperazione tra le differenti realtà coinvolte. In tale prospettiva, Extramoenia d.o.o. ottimizza e rinforza assiduamente ogni rapporto strategico fondamentale per il buon fine delle azioni di parternariato, lobby strategica e networking a partire dalla Slovenia stessa, per poi eventualmente espandersi anche agli altri Paesi facenti parte della Macroregione Adriatico-Ionica (Croazia, Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro) e a qualsiasi altro Paese in cui ci sia richiesta di idee innovative da concretizzarsi sui bandi UE.",European,"a) technical assistance for planning, writing, presentation and management of projects corresponding to EU calls ; b) advising and preparation of projects corresponding to national and regional calls.

writing of the project, preparation of relative financial plans, compilation of projectual form and of all the forms indicated in the call, delivery of the project, entirely transcribed on the forms and within the expiry terms indicated by the ban, both to the client and the competent Community Offices;

Européennes : - Le Conseil de l’Union européenne, la Commission européenne, le Parlement européen.- Les organes consultatifs : Le Conseil du Comité des Régions, le Conseil Economique et Social Européen. Ministérielles : Les Gouvernements des 28 Etats membres de l’Union européenne et des pays candidats. Parlementaires :- Les Parlements des 28 Etats membres et des pays candidats.- En France, l’Assemblée nationale et le Sénat. Locales : - Les collectivités térritoriales des 28 Etats membres de l’Union européenne et des pays candidats.- En France, les régions, départements, communes, ainsi que les structures intercommunales. constituent des outils indispensables à la prise de décision pour nos clients : entreprises, ONG, fédérations professionnelles, associations, collectivités territoriales... Cette démarche de croisement des cultures française et européenne, locale et nationale a présidé à la création de Schell & Associés ( puis eclusivement Cabinet Schell à partir de 2015), en 2000, avec l’objectif d’assister et de promouvoir votre entreprise auprès des différents niveaux de collectivités publiques à Bruxelles et à Paris, comme dans les autres pays de l’Union, pour savoir et agir au cœur des institutions. Une Méthode : Construire une Stratégie d'Influence 1 - Le pilotage des réseaux Pour chaque dossier, nous établirons avec vous une cartographie des décideurs et des relais d’opinion. Pour démultiplier les effets de nos interventions et en accroître l'efficacité, nous activerons les relais personnels de nos experts, toujours sélectionnés en fonction de leurs connaissances de votre secteur d’activité. Nous activerons notre réseau politique d'élus locaux, de parlementaires, de hauts fonctionnaires, de membres des cabinets ministériels, de permanents de partis politiques et des organisations patronales et consulaires en France et à Bruxelles auprès du Parlement, de la Commission, du Conseil, du Comité des Régions, des Représentations Permanentes... 2 - La veille politique Cette veille sera à la fois parlementaire mais consistera également dans la recherche et l’analyse d’informations sensibles, le plus en amont possible, en particulier au niveau de la Commission européenne qui dispose du droit d’initiative en proposant les actes législatifs qui seront ensuite soumis au Parlement et au Conseil. Le travail de veille parlementaire à Bruxelles consiste à détecter dans les travaux du Parlement européen l’actualité législative qui concerne les préoccupations de votre entreprise. En effet, la quantité et la haute spécialisation des travaux du Parlement rendent moins lisibles les activités de cette institution. Ainsi, par un service personnalisé et par nos contacts réguliers avec le Parlement européen, nous mettons en place un suivi législatif adapté à vos besoins. L’organisation de la veille permet ensuite de déterminer, avec votre entreprise, un plan d’action pour intervenir dans le processus de décision institutionnelle (en co-décision le plus souvent) Nous exerçons ce travail de veille parlementaire régulièrement à Paris en suivant les travaux de l’Assemblée nationale et du Sénat. Nous pouvons mettre en place un système d’alerte sur l’actualité politique et les travaux parlementaires dans d’autres capitales de l’Union européenne. 3 - Le plan media Notre stratégie de relations avec les média comporte plusieurs étapes : - Après définition, avec votre entreprise, des mots clefs de sa compétence ou de sa recherche, le suivi presse consiste à lui adresser régulièrement les articles et les dépêches d’agence qui la concerne directement.- Ce suivi presse est complété par des exercices de media training et de prises de parole en","European, national, regional/local","En 2015, le Cabinet a suivi plusieurs thématiques en lien avec les sujets traités à Bruxelles, en particulier dans les principaux domaines d'activité suivants: santé publique, nutrition et alimentation, sécurité alimentaire,recherche de fonds européens questions bancaires et fiscales commerce de détail, consommateurs, agriculture et environnement marché intérieur et concurrence , blanchiment et lutte contre le crime organisé politique régionale justice et affaires intérieures etc...","Eric Schell a rédigé le chapitre sur les affaires publiques en France dans le cadre de la publication coordonnée par Stuart Thompson et édité par ""urbanpublications.com"".

Moreover, the Report provides recommendations, both in terms of general policy orientations and concrete areas of engagement, for EU STI policy to contribute to the implementation, in Europe and beyond, of the 2030 Agenda, as well as for possible engagements in international initiatives concerning STI.

Seitdem hat sich die eusg zu einer neuen innovativen Hybrid-Institution weiterentwickelt, die sich in ergänzendem und fruchtbarem Austausch zwischen Bildung, Forschung und Beratung mit dem Fokus auf Demokratie und Governance in Europa und der MENA Region bewegt. Ihre Mitarbeiter verfügen über langjährige Erfahrungen in der politischen Bildung und der strategischen Politikberatung im öffentlichen und privaten Sektor sowie in der Wissenschaft.  
Die eusg gehört zur gemeinnützigen Forschungsstiftung Parmenides Foundation, die sich der Kognitionsforschung widmet und deren Ergebnisse wiederum in die Beratungsprojekte, Studienangebote und Think Tanks der eusg einfließen. Die Stiftung hat es sich zur Aufgabe gemacht, das Phänomen Denken zu erforschen. Umgesetzt wird diese Aufgabenstellung im Rahmen eines interdisziplinären Forschungsansatzes, der insbesondere die Neurowissenschaften und die Philosophie, die Neuroinformatik und die kognitive Psychologie, die Linguistik und die evolutionäre Anthropologie verbinden soll. 
 
Tätigkeitsschwerpunkte der eusg sind: 
•Beratung von Regierungen, NGOs und Internationale Organisationen: strategische Politikberatung unter Einsatz von Parmenides EIDOS ® 
•Evaluation und Konsistenzüberprüfung von Good Governance Zielsetzungen, Strategien und Change Management Prozessen 
•Entwicklung von Szenarien und Begleitung von Foresight Prozessen

Kernanliegen des EDL ist das Vorantreiben der Idee einer res publica europaea, bei dem das europäische Gemeinwohl und die Transnationalität der gesamten europäischen Politik, über den Nationalstaat hinaus betont wird. Ein transnationales Paradigma ist essenziel für die Überwindung der nationalstaatlichen Denkweise, um die derzeit pfadabhängig schlecht konzipierte Wirtschaftspolitik zu ändern, bei der die europäischen Volkswirtschaften immernoch in Konkurrenz zueinander gesehen werden.

Ambiente Italia nasce nel 1995 con l’obiettivo di realizzare – anche in Italia – un istituto di ricerca ambientale autorevole e indipendente, sul modello degli eco-istituti che in quegli anni andavano formandosi in numerosi Paesi europei. Raccogliendo l’esperienza di Cooperativa Ecologia, fondata all’inizio degli anni ’80 a Milano, Ambiente Italia ha aggregato diverse strutture locali di consulenza (in Veneto, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Toscana, Lazio e Sicilia) per assumere una dimensione nazionale. Attraverso una presenza continua e riconosciuta a tutti i livelli, ha apportato soluzioni innovative e originali alle politiche ambientali ed energetiche italiane, assumendo progressivamente un posizionamento riconosciuto nel campo della ricerca, consulenza e progettazione per la sostenibilità ambientale. 
In venti anni di attività Ambiente Italia ha lavorato con: 
•    Imprese del settore agroalimentare, manifatturiero, edile e dei servizi 
•    Comuni, Province e Regioni 
•    Enti di gestione di Parchi e aree protette 
•    Public utilities e gestori di servizi pubblici nei settori dell’energia, dei rifiuti e delle acque 
•    Istituzioni e Agenzie nazionali ed europee 
 
Ambiente Italia propone da 20 anni soluzioni per la sostenibilità a livello nazionale ed europeo. La nostra mission consiste nella realizzazione di studi e progetti in grado di definire gli standard e i termini di riferimento per le principali politiche ambientali. 
Con la costituzione, nel 2010, di Ambiente Italia Progetti, società di ingegneria e progettazione ci proponiamo insieme a un qualificato gruppo di partner (singoli professionisti e imprese) come soggetto in grado di seguire l’intera filiera della pianificazione, progettazione e realizzazione di interventi per l’ambiente e la sostenibilità.

We also believe that our customers are inundated with confusing industry noise, vendor fatigue with increasing pressure to make the right decisions quickly. 
 
To address these requirements TechVision Research has assembled a “dream team” of Consulting Analysts that can be trusted to support the most critical and difficult technology decisions an organization will make. The experience and diversity of our team provides business-level support and vision for CXOs and senior IT executives as well as pragmatic architecture and deep technology analysis for in-house architects and subject matter experts. The combination of “real world” consulting experience and “best of breed” analyst skills gives our clients the best of both worlds. 
 
We believe research analysts, by the nature of the work, can get disconnected from many of the on-the-ground factors that determine success in an organization. Because of the complexity and rapid changes in technology and security today, we feel it is necessary to have the experience and currency of our Consulting Analysts. 
 
It is our philosophy that research must be widely available within a client organization to be most valuable. It seems like an obvious concept but not one that our competitors follow. We provide annual subscriptions at an enterprise-level, so no more worrying about sorting out the have and have nots when it comes to availability of research.
